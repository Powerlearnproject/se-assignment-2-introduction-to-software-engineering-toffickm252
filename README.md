ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. 
1.	Define Software Engineering.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.[1] (Semeraro, n.d.)



2.	What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. (Semeraro, n.d.)
So, while programming is centered on the code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development. (Tech, n.d.)

3. 3.	Software Development Life cycle. 
The software development life cycle is a process that development teams use to create awesome software that's top-notch in terms of quality, cost-effectiveness, and time efficiency.
This helps in managing the change of requirements and staying on top of new technology, and collaborative work with the product team. (Clark, n.d.)
The life cycle is as follows.
# Planning and Analysis
The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders. This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc.
# Define Requirements 
This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. This process guides the development of several important documents: a software requirement specification (SRS) or product specification, a Use Case document, and a Requirement Traceability Matrix document.
# Design
The design phase is where you put pen to paper—so to speak. The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) that includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use, and application security measures. This is also where you can flowchart how the software responds to user actions. 
# Development 
The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product.
# Testing 
The product needs to fit for purpose before its finally released. Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do. The testing process can also help hash out any major user experience issues and security issues.
# Deployment 
During the deployment phase, your final product is delivered to your intended user. You can automate this process and schedule your deployment depending on the type. For example, if you are only deploying a feature update, you can do so with a small number of users (canary release). 
# Maintenance 
The maintenance phase is the final stage of the SDLC if you’re following the waterfall structure of the software development process. However, the industry is moving towards a more agile software development approach where maintenance is only a stage for further improvement. This process is mostly repetitive as I must be done every time there are faults or bugs in the running of the software. (Clark, n.d.)


   4.  Agile vs. Waterfall Models. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 
The two models compared project management methods.
The waterfall model of software development is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline.
The agile model of software development is a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high-quality results within shorter timeframes. It’s very often used in software development.
Agile model	Waterfall model
Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecycles, as each iteration delivers a workable product While Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released.
Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process while 	Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to change once the project's scope has been defined.

Waterfall works well when the customer's demands are precise and when there are no significant changes in scope or technology during the project.
Agile is a good fit in cases where the end goal may be unclear or difficult to define when complex systems require frequent feedback loops, or when timelines and budgets are tight. [4] (Liz Lockhart, n.d.)

5. 5.	What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. (Geeks For Geeks, n.d.)
Requirements engineering involves tasks such as requirement analysis, elicitation, documentation, conciliation, and validation. The use of automated requirement engineering tools improves communication and collaboration among client stakeholders and engineers, even when they are not in the same geographic location. It also helps in writing accurate and complete test requests and test cases. Overall, requirements engineering ensures that software requirements are collected with care and helps in creating secure and successful software products that meet customer needs and expectations. (Annonymous, 2024)

  6. Software Design Principles. Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems?
