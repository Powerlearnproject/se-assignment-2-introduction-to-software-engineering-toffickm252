# ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. 
# 1.	Define Software Engineering.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.[1] (Semeraro, n.d.)



# 2.	What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. (Semeraro, n.d.)
So, while programming is centered on the code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development. (Tech, n.d.)

# 3.Software Development Life cycle. 
The software development life cycle is a process that development teams use to create awesome software that's top-notch in terms of quality, cost-effectiveness, and time efficiency.
This helps in managing the change of requirements and staying on top of new technology, and collaborative work with the product team. (Clark, n.d.)
The life cycle is as follows.
# Planning and Analysis
The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders. This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc.
# Define Requirements 
This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. This process guides the development of several important documents: a software requirement specification (SRS) or product specification, a Use Case document, and a Requirement Traceability Matrix document.
# Design
The design phase is where you put pen to paper—so to speak. The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) that includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use, and application security measures. This is also where you can flowchart how the software responds to user actions. 
# Development 
The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product.
# Testing 
The product needs to fit for purpose before its finally released. Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do. The testing process can also help hash out any major user experience issues and security issues.
# Deployment 
During the deployment phase, your final product is delivered to your intended user. You can automate this process and schedule your deployment depending on the type. For example, if you are only deploying a feature update, you can do so with a small number of users (canary release). 
# Maintenance 
The maintenance phase is the final stage of the SDLC if you’re following the waterfall structure of the software development process. However, the industry is moving towards a more agile software development approach where maintenance is only a stage for further improvement. This process is mostly repetitive as I must be done every time there are faults or bugs in the running of the software. (Clark, n.d.)


   # 4.  Agile vs. Waterfall Models. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 
The two models compared project management methods.
The waterfall model of software development is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline.
The agile model of software development is a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high-quality results within shorter timeframes. It’s very often used in software development.
# Agile model VRS	Waterfall model
Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecycles, as each iteration delivers a workable product While Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released.
Agile encourages teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process while 	Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to change once the project's scope has been defined.

Waterfall works well when the customer's demands are precise and when there are no significant changes in scope or technology during the project.
Agile is a good fit in cases where the end goal may be unclear or difficult to define when complex systems require frequent feedback loops, or when timelines and budgets are tight. [4] (Liz Lockhart, n.d.)

# 5.	What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. (Geeks For Geeks, n.d.)
Requirements engineering involves tasks such as requirement analysis, elicitation, documentation, conciliation, and validation. The use of automated requirement engineering tools improves communication and collaboration among client stakeholders and engineers, even when they are not in the same geographic location. It also helps in writing accurate and complete test requests and test cases. Overall, requirements engineering ensures that software requirements are collected with care and helps in creating secure and successful software products that meet customer needs and expectations. (Annonymous, 2024)

  # 6. Software Design Principles. Explain the concept of modularity in software design.How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software engineering refers to the design approach that emphasizes the separation of concerns, where a complex software system is divided into smaller, loosely coupled modules.

Each module performs a specific function or handles a particular feature, and they interact through well-defined interfaces.

This approach promotes a clear division of labor, allowing developers to focus on individual modules without being overwhelmed by the entire system’s complexity.

# How modularity improves software maintainability and scalability. 
As software systems grow in complexity, maintenance can become a challenging task.
However, by designing software with modularity in mind, updates and bug fixes can be applied to individual modules without affecting the entire system.
This minimizes the risk of introducing new bugs and makes it easier to troubleshoot and test the changes. (Institute of Data , n.d.)

# 7.	Testing in Software Engineering. Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
# 1.	Unit Testing: 
In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software.
# 2.	Integration Testing:
In this testing, two or more modules that are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected.
# 3.	System Testing: 
In system testing, complete and integrated Software are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.
# 4.	Acceptance Testing: 
This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment. . (Geeks for Geeks, n.d.)

# Why testing is crucial in software development.
Software testing reduces project risks related to software quality, security and performance. For example, software defects can lead to system failures, data breaches, slow performance and other significant impacts. (IEEE Computer Society, n.d.)

# 8. Version Control Systems. What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features
Version control - also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. It is closely related to source code management.
# Importance 
Version control enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.
# Examples 
# Git 
Git is the most popular option and has become synonymous with "source code management." Git is an open source distributed system that is used for software projects of any size, making it a popular option for startups, enterprise, and everything in between.

# Subversion (SVN) 
SVN is a widely adopted centralized VCS. This system keeps all of a project's files on a single codeline making it impossible to branch, so it's easy to scale for large projects. It's simple to learn and features folder security measures, so access to subfolders can be restricted.

# Mercurial 
Mercurial is a distributed VCS that offers simple branching and merging capabilities. The system enables rapid scaling and collaborative development, with an intuitive interface. The flexible command line interface enables users to begin using the system immediately. (Gitlab, n.d.)

# 9. Software Project Management. Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software project managers are responsible for the preparation and implementation of the software projects. Software project manager’s responsibilities are to analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project’s internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project’s key performance indicators. (Sharma, n.d.)

# Challenges they face. 
Poor communication between team members is one of the worst things that can affect a project team. Misunderstanding, miscommunications, and misinterpretations can cause strife between team members, lead to poor outcomes, and delay project completion. (Kazmi, 2024)

# 10. Software Maintenance. Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
# Software Maintenance
Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.
# Types of maintenance activities 
# Corrective Software Maintenance
Corrective software maintenance is the typical, classic form of maintenance (for software and anything else for that matter). Corrective software maintenance is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors. These can have a widespread impact on the functionality of the software in general and therefore must be addressed as quickly as possible.

# Preventative Software Maintenance
Preventative software maintenance is looking into the future so that your software can keep working as desired for as long as possible. This includes making necessary changes, upgrades, adaptations and more. Preventative software maintenance may address small issues which at the given time may lack significance but may turn into larger problems in the future. 

# Perfective Software Maintenance
As with any product on the market, once the software is released to the public, new issues and ideas come to the surface. Users may see the need for new features or requirements that they would like to see in the software to make it the best tool available for their needs. This is when perfective software maintenance comes into play. 

# Adaptive Software Maintenance
Adaptive software maintenance has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software. These include operating system changes, cloud storage, hardware, etc. When these changes are performed, your software must adapt in order to properly meet new requirements and continue to run well.

# Why maintenance is important in the software lifecycle. 
Creating a new piece of software and launching it into the world is an exciting step for any company. A lot goes into creating your software and its launch including the actual building and coding, licensing models, marketing, and more. However, any great piece of software must be able to adapt to the times. (Thales Group , n.d.)

 # 11. Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering. What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
# Ethical issues software Engineers face. 
-	1. Unethical data collection
With the shift to digital marketing, companies are exponentially valuing user data. It’s an important source to use in development. However, it’s easy to get carried away in the act of acquiring it. Customers have to be fully aware of what information they’re sharing and how it’s going to be used.
-	2. Algorithmic bias
Computers cannot understand morality as a concept. When it is not thoroughly checked, its systems can unintentionally show bias. For instance, when it was discovered that Google’s image processing engine couldn’t adequately reflect black and brown skin tones in images, the company came under fire for allegedly fostering systematic racism
-	3.  Weak security
The software industry is prone to security issues. Developers need further education to learn and implement proper security practices. However, these kinds of training are often limited to cybersecurity-specific seminars.

# How software engineers can adhere to ethical standards 
-	1. Be proactive
While you work honestly when writing code, there’s no telling where it can lead to. The client and your team can easily veer away from the original purpose of your project.Throughout the process of development, think of the potential threats and misconduct that can happen. As a software engineer, you must assess the current technology you’re developing and take proactive measures to address any potential abuse and other ethical issues in software development.

-	2. Be a responsible citizen 
Software developers have this opportunity to build a product that will either benefit users or hurt them. Prioritize your responsibilities as a good citizen over your reputation as an expert. Only work on projects that you believe are secure, comply with specifications, and can withstand mandatory testing. By offering your expert technical services to worthy causes, you act responsibly as a citizen. (Full Scale, 2024)
